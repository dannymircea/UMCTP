This is the README for my proj
====================
A ultra basic cpp file for git learning

* * *

Program output
--------------------
It outputs "Yo nigga" string followed by a list of the command line arguments if any

Current state
--------------------
At the moment I want to add sashadex[pseudo-fictional character] as a contributor/collaborator 
As a collaborator you need to:
	* exist as a person
	* have a certain amount of interest in what github has to offer
	* have good/great ideas
	* always seek to learn new things
